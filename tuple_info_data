*********************************************************************************************************
* Description
Jets in flat tuple format derived from /Jet/Run2011A-12Oct2013-v1/AOD primary dataset.

Accelerator:CERN-LHC 
Experiment: CMS 
Parent Dataset: /Jet/Run2011A-12Oct2013-v1/AOD
Preprocessed data for the jet analysis example

*Characteristics 
Dataset: 25607902 events 1 file 7.8G GB in total

*System Details 
Software release: CMSSW_5_3_32

*How were these data selected?
This file contains the jet candidates in flat tuple format derived from the full 2011 RunA Jet primary dataset. The collection was filtered with the list of the validated runs. Additionally, jet candidates with $p_T < 15 GeV$ and $|\eta| > 5$ were discarded. These datasets were produced with the code in:

*How were these data validated?
Only the list of validated runs have been accepted.

CMS list of validated runs for primary datasets of 2011 data taking

*How can you use these data?
The data can be further analysed with the analysis example code available in
the jet inclusive cross section analysis example of CMS 2011 open data

*Issues & Limitations
The file contains only jet collections, other physics object collections have been discarded.
